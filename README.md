## Interesting Code Snippet

Here’s one part of the project I’m proud of—how transactions are parsed from a line in a CSV file:

```java
double amount = Double.parseDouble(parts[4].trim()); // Parse the amount

This line safely extracts the transaction amount from a CSV line after trimming whitespace. If the data format is off, it throws a clear NumberFormatException, which helps with debugging.
