# My Accounting Ledger App

This is a simple accounting ledger application built in Java. It allows users to add, view, and manage financial transactions via a text-based menu.

## ðŸ§  Interesting Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s one part of the project Iâ€™m proud ofâ€”how transactions are parsed from a line in a CSV file:

```java
double amount = Double.parseDouble(parts[4].trim()); // Parse the amount

This line safely extracts the transaction amount from a CSV line after trimming whitespace. If the data format is off, it throws a clear NumberFormatException, which helps with debugging.
